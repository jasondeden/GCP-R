# GCP-R

This is a collection of scripts designed to accomplish certain things in GCP. Start with the Connect and Test instructions (it says GCS, but also includes a BigQuery example). There may be errors or omissions in steps - this is for fun and schoolwork and should not be used for business or production purposes without serious vetting.
